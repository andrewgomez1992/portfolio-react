                        <p>I would consider myself a very thoughtful and creative individual. 
        Supported with emotional intelligence. I have a very clear understanding 
        of the needs of those around me. I am very curious, if I had 100 lifetimes 
        I would have no problem staying busy and learning new things in each and every one of them.
